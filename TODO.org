* Bugs
Background image doesn't work. 
CompileImages: Failed to find CONTENT image file "panorama/images/draft-background-image.png"

* Publish

* Playtesting
 1. Does deward still work?
 2. Do sub-abilities work?
 3. Do any other abilities fail?

* Styling
Generally it looks quite ugly at present.

Should we have some transition to indicate who you're passing your cards to?

* Audio
Perhaps we should have some sounds to indicate you've picked?
