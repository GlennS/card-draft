* Bad abilities
Check through to make sure there aren't any remaining bad abilities.

* Ability Names
When display in Panorama, they work when they're a tooltip, but not otherwise.

* Credits
Separate tab for credits - not sure how this works, but beacon fire has it.

* Styling
Generally it looks quite ugly at present.

Should we have some transition to indicate who you're passing your cards to?
