* Model Loading Problem
Cosmetic items, special couriers and summoner units don't display properly.

* Doesn't pass hand for players on the same team
Keep iterating through.

If we find no players in a whole numbered slot, then go back to slot 1.

* Feedback on what you've picked
 + Increase timer slightly.
 + Make the rounds have a minimum time limit.
 + Animations/transitions?
 + Message to say 'you should pick'.
 + Let the player know what they picked.

* Layout Cards Differently
A row each for things?

* Styling
Generally it looks quite ugly at present.

Should we have some transition to indicate who you're passing your cards to?
